# Twitter-Scraper
Scrape, download, and update tweets for a bunch of users. 
Quick and Dirty, the script does what should do.

This repository contains a unique file:
  - create_and_update_data.py 
    This file creates and uploads a database of tweets from a list of users. 
    The informations are stored in a unique file all_tweets.txt and in a summary file (.pny)
    
   
#### Warning.
After the first run, about 3200 tweets per users will be stored. 
Then, run the script in the same folder every day/week/10days depending on the number of tweets produced by your users.
